## Usage

After clicking to get started, the user can type notes into the sections labelled "Note Title" and "Note Text". They are then stored in the left side panel and can be brought back up to the main viewport by clicking on them again. It is a simple front-facing application that utilizes GET and POST requests to get the user information from the notes and allow further posting with user input.
